# release-task-hour-burndown
Generates a burndown of task hours associated with a release
This app will generate a burndown chart based on the Release selected in the dropdown when the app is added to a Custom HTML app on a dashboard in Rally.  All stories in a release should be decomposed into tasks with hour estimates before the release begins to have the best viewing experience.  This practice in and of itself is not very agile but if a company has some agile teams and some not so agile teams this app could work for them.

Thanks to Thom Gray for the code
